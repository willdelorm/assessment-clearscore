## Assumptions

Based on the company's website design, this ideas board will be visually minimal and simple to read at a glance.

- A "New Idea" tile will exist on the left side for easy entry.
- Existing ideas will be organized in a single column to the right.
- A vertical design approach will make each item easy to read and retain clear organization.
- This project will not contain authentication or backend synchronization, with the assumption that it can be later integrated.

### Technologies to be used

- Latest ECMAScript standards
- React (TypeScript) + Vite
- Jest for unit testing
